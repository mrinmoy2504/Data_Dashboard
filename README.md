# Data_Dashboard

☄️ Landed a new project on Data Analysis and Visualization using Python libraries like Matplotlib , Pandas and Seaborn Software . 
Made an interactive and visually engaging dashboard from 'AI Job Trends from 2024 - 2030 ' dataset that was collected from Kaggle . 

📑 Data Retrieval and Cleaning :
Used pandas to read the .csv file and as the dataset was a high quality one that's why there was not that much useless inputs in it . Though for some specific graphs and analysis I used mean() function and round() method for changing the float points to integers . 

 📊 Data Visualization :
Now this was the most tough part as I ran into lot of challenges and code bugs that required lot patience and time to resolve . Used matplotlib plt.subplots to draw the figure canvas and seaborn plotting functions to plot the visuals . As I changed the color of background of the figures the axes tick labels also needed to be formatted accordingly . Used .set_color and .set_tickparams for the changes . Also used a custom color pallette for the theme. 
Used matplotlib and seaborn for most of the visual part . 

 📈 Visualization Platform :
Found Streamlit as one of the most convenient way to get outputs for analytical dashboards . Functions such as st.markdown , st.caption , st.pyplot to plot the graphs as output .
Also made a new layout for the page as I divided it in three parts using st.set_page_config function . 

🐱 Github Deployment :
Streamlit web apps can be deployed using hosting services . As I intended that others should experience the dashboard themselves I deployed it using GitHub repo with the hosting of streamlit community cloud .
